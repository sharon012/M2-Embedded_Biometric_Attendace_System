## Introduction

According to researchers from Pen state University, humans are more likely to trust machines over people, which is likely evident from us revealing our ATM pin to a machine so easily. Today, in the world where AI, Machine learning, Chat bots, Smart Speakers, Robots etc are actively progressing, this synergy between humans and robots is only set to increase. Today, from bridge toll collectors to check-out cashiers everything around us is being replaced by machines to get the work done easier and more efficient.

##  Benefits

Fingerprint attendance systems are already readily available directly from the market, but what is more fun than building one. In this project, we have used fingerprint Module and AVR(atmega32) to register attendance. By using fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users. Following sections explains technical details of making a fingerprint-based Biometric Attendance System using AVR.

## Cost and Features

Our range of systems record the daily attendance and working hours of the employees in an organization and are quite reliable. Fingerprint Time & Attendance Userâ€™s Guide It is convenient to operate the fingerprint time &attendance machine. Users can select menu, keyboard inputting and all kinds of setting with 5 function keys and number keys. And the voice message and a beep sound will inform users whether the operation is correct or not.
