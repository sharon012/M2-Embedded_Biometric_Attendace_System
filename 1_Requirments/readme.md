**Introduction**

According to researchers from Pen state University, humans are more likely to trust machines over people, which is likely evident from us revealing our ATM pin to a machine so easily. Today, in the world where AI, Machine learning, Chat bots, Smart Speakers, Robots etc are actively progressing, this synergy between humans and robots is only set to increase. Today, from bridge toll collectors to check-out cashiers everything around us is being replaced by machines to get the work done easier and more efficient.

## Objective

To keep up with the phase, in this project we will build a Bio-metric Attendance system using AVR microcontrollers to replace the manual procedure of taking attendance. This system will be more reliable and efficient since it would save time and avoid dodgers.  

## Benefits

Fingerprint attendance systems are already readily available directly from the market, but what is more fun than building one. In this project, we have used fingerprint Module and AVR(atmega32) to register attendance. By using fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users. Following sections explains technical details of making a fingerprint-based Biometric Attendance System using AVR.

## Cost and Features

Our range of systems record the daily attendance and working hours of the employees in an organization and are quite reliable. Fingerprint Time & Attendance User’s Guide It is convenient to operate the fingerprint time &attendance machine. Users can select menu, keyboard inputting and all kinds of setting with 5 function keys and number keys. And the voice message and a beep sound will inform users whether the operation is correct or not. .

## Who

Moving to a biometric attendance system is the first step in your journey to enhance the security of your organisation and increase the productivity of your employees.

## What

A biometric attendance machine is a device which is used to verify the identity of a person. The characteristics used to identify a person include fingerprints, voice patterns, iris, face recognition, and hand measurements.

## When

A biometric attendance machine is a device which is used to verify the identity of a person. The characteristics used to identify a person include fingerprints, voice patterns, iris, face recognition, and hand measurements.

## Where

The main uses of biometric systems and devices are identification and authentication. Biometric devices are most commonly used in security, banking, mobile access and authentication, law enforcement, public transports, schools, home assistants, and building access.

## How

This program can be executed in a system which has Linux or Windows operating system.

## SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strengths

Store backup data quickly with USB connectivity.Designed intelligently to ensure the lowest errors.Store and verify a large number of fingerprints.Easy to use and track employee attendance.Good to maintain a high level of security.

## Weakness

Data breaches – Biometric databases can still be hacked. Tracking and data – Biometric devices like facial recognition systems can limit privacy for users.

## Opportunities

The characteristics used to identify a person include fingerprints, voice patterns, iris, face recognition, and hand measurements.

## Threats
Insufficient network security.
Insufficient peripheral security.
Improper configuration of systems or devices.
